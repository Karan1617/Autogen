=================

Main code for a two-agent literature review assistant using AutoGen (v0.4+).

It has one main function: `run_litrev()`

The two agents:
1. search_agent - searches for papers using arXiv.
2. summarizer - writes a short summary from the found papers.

This file works on its own and can be used in apps like CLI, Streamlit, FastAPI, Gradio, etc.
